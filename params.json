You should think of this as Android-PullToRefresh's younger, leaner cousin.\r\n\r\n### This is a Preview\r\nPlease note that this is currently in a preview state. This basically means that the API is not fixed and you should expect changes between releases.\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\nAs this is a preview also means that function is missing. See the [Todo](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/wiki/Todo) page for more info on what needs to be added.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Sample\r\n\r\nEventually the sample will be available to download on Google Play. As we're not stable yet you can find the APK [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxAFUoBj0OjaYTd3SUkzYjIydG8&usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Supported Views\r\n\r\nActionBar-PullToRefresh has in-built support for:\r\n\r\n * AbsListView derivatives (ListView & GridView).\r\n * ScrollView\r\n * WebView\r\n\r\nIf the View you want to use is not listed above, you can easily add support by providing a `Delegate`. See the 'Delegates' section below for more info.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nYou just need to create an instance of `PullToRefreshAttacher`, giving it the Activity and the View for which will scroll.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nprivate PullToRefreshAttacher mPullToRefreshHelper;\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n        \r\n    // Get View for which the user will scrollâ€¦\r\n    View scrollableView = findViewById(R.id.blah); \r\n\r\n    mPullToRefreshHelper = new PullToRefreshAttacher(this, scrollableView);\r\n    mPullToRefreshHelper.setRefreshListener(this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n__See the [ListView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/blob/master/sample/src/uk/co/senab/actionbarpulltorefresh/sample/ListViewActivity.java) sample for more info.__\r\n  \r\n---\r\n\r\n## Customisation    \r\n    \r\n### Delegates\r\nTODO. See the [GridView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/blob/master/sample/src/uk/co/senab/actionbarpulltorefresh/sample/GridViewActivity.java) sample for more info for now.\r\n\r\n### HeaderTransformers\r\nTODO. See the [GridView](https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh/blob/master/sample/src/uk/co/senab/actionbarpulltorefresh/sample/GridViewActivity.java) sample for more info for now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2013 Chris Banes\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
